# Tutorial
This task serves as a demonstration of your ability to 
complete assignments independently. 
Such tasks **will not be checked** by anything other than 
pre-defined tests. The platform won't be able to see if 
you managed to complete this task, so **we'll be working 
on trust** between each other. If you genuinely want to learn
**Java**, I highly recommend completing all of these tasks.

## Instructions

1. To get this project for yourself, you need to click on the ``Fork`` button in the top right corner;
2. Next, you can change the repository name, but it's optional, and then click on the ``Create Fork`` button;
3. After that, the repository will be added to your account. Click on the ``Code`` button and copy the **HTTPS** link;
4. Now, open your **IntelliJ IDEA** and click on ``Get From VCS``;
5. In the opened window, paste the copied link and click ``Clone``.

### How to work with tests?

Congratulations, now you can work on the task locally on your machine.
Open the class with the name ``Task`` and complete the assignment. 
Once you finish, click on the ``Run Code`` button, and the tests will run. 
**Each test's name indicates what it checks**, so if any of the tests 
don't pass, you can understand what's wrong.
